# SFML And Signals Deliverable

This project uses the [SFML library](http://www.sfml-dev.org/index.php). The installation was achieved by following the steps explained in the `./006-SFMLAndSignals/SFML_installation_instructions.pdf` file. The `dylib`s, `Framework`s, `XCode Template`s and `extlib`s were installed in the indicated paths. The project was generated by choosing the `SFML CLT` template. Also, the project scheme (Product -> Scheme -> Edit Scheme...) was modified to have a custom working directory equal to the project's resources path.
