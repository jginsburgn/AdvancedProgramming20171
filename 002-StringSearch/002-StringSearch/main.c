//Task directions:
//String search
//Write a program that counts how many times a word appears inside of a sentence.
//
//You can define two strings as arrays of chars, of sizes 100 and 10. The program will ask the user for these strings. The first string will be a full sentence, and the second one will be a word. You should use pointers to solve this problem.
//
//For example, with the following input:
//
//"This one is larger than the other one over there" and "one", the program should print that the string "one" appears 2 times in the sentence.
//
//You can do this easily with the functions "strchr", "strstr" and "strncmp". Try doing the program with or without these functions. You can always use "strlen".
