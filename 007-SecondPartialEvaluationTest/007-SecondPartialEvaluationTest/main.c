It is a project for evaluating the second partial of the Advanced Programming class. This program brings together the concepts of threads and mutexes:\n\nEach reel is shifted by an independent thread. Yet another thread, the UI one, is in charge of printing the reels' window and reading input from the user. Furthermore, each reel is represented by a character array, and another character array is used as aid during the shift operation; therefore, a mutex is used because all these arrays are shared among threads.\n\nTo pull the lever of the machine, press enter.
